#EndorseTrust
An algorithm for evaluating the reputation score of workers in a task public system.

We use a collaborative Filtering method, i.e. Latent Factor, to predict a endorser's confidence to a target task. And then we evaluate the target user's reputation score by taking both the user and his or her endorsers into account. 

Experiment data is generated by random, which could also be replaced by real world data, such as data from www.zhihu.com
